Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides
support for the usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...)
without extending any core JavaScript objects.

###  What to Use underscore.js for and When to Use It
* When you want more than just DOM manipulations and animations provided by jQuery, beyond the browser. Underscore can be used both in the browser and on the server.
* Since not all new JavaScript functionality is available in all browsers, underscore.js will provide JavaScript funcionality that works across all browsers.
* Write less code and avoid repeating yourself when writing routine functionality on Collections, Objects, Arrays, Function, Utilities and Templates.
