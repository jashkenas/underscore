Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides
support for the usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...)
without extending any core JavaScript objects.

###  What to Use underscore.js for and When to Use It
* Since not all new JavaScript functionality is available in all browsers, underscore.js will make your code work across all browsers.
* Keep performance as optimal as possible.
* Avoid repetiting yourself in complex code.
