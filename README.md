Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides
support for the usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...)
without extending any core JavaScript objects.

### What to use Underscore.js for and when to use it

* Provides vanilla JavaScript implementations of utility functions, not extending any core objects.
* A good foundation for adopting a functional programming style.
* Supports cross browser compatible implementations of new JavaScript functionality.
* Beyond the browser, Underscore.js operates on the client, server and relational databases.
* Underscore.js can be used to create JavaScript templates.
* Write routine functionality on Collections, Objects, Arrays, Functions, Utilities and Templates with less code, while avoiding repetitions.
