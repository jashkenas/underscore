Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides
support for the usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...)
without extending any core JavaScript objects.

###What is Underscore.js in layman's term?
Say you want to change channel on your TV. You can either get off the couch and walk over to the TV or you can effortlessly press a button using a little device called the TV remote.

Underscore.js is similar to a TV remote. The remote has many functions that you can use at a press of a button, such as change to specific channel, increase or decrease volume, find the last channel or channel surf in descending or ascending order. Like a remote, Underscore.js has all types of functions to help with sorting, selecting, inserting and deleting data that are sitting on the sideline waiting to be used by your application.
