Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides
support for the usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...)
without extending any core JavaScript objects.

Underscore.js contains functions to perform common operations on data and it works on arrays, JSON objects, etc. It pairs nicely with jQuery and developers tend to use Underscore.js to manipulate the data first and then jQuery for laying out the results on a page

### What to use Underscore.js for and when to use It

* When you need to stick to vanilla JavaScript implementations of utility functions, not extending any core objects.
* Since not all new JavaScript functionality is available in all browsers, Underscore.js will provide JavaScript funcionality that works across all browsers.
* When you want more than just DOM manipulations and animations provided by jQuery, beyond the browser. Underscore.js can be used both on client and server.
* Write less code and avoid repeating yourself when writing routine functionality on Collections, Objects, Arrays, Function, Utilities and Templates.
